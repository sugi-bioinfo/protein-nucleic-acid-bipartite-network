Protein–Nucleic Acid Bipartite Network

This repository contains scripts developed to construct
a bipartite network representation of protein–nucleic acid
interactions from PDB structures.

The algorithm identifies protein–nucleic acid contacts,
computes interaction strength, applies a threshold (Imin),
and performs network and cluster analysis.
